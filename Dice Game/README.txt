This is a dice game with 2 players. 

The Javascript code is going to generate a random number between 1-6 and pick up the dice images based on those random numbers and place them with the help of CSS code.

If the random number of the first dice is greater than then random numer of the second dic or vice-versa, then the h1 heading is gonna display "Player 1 Wins" or "Player 2 Wins" respectively. 

But if both the random numbers are equal ,then the h1 heading is gonna display "It's a Draw!"
